# Humans vs. Zombies

Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ) is a game of tag played at schools, camps, neighborhoods, libraries, and conventions around the world. The game simulates the exponential spread of a fictional zombie infection through a population. This application creates the base for the games to playing in the real world.
